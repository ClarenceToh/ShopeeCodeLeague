## Order Brushing
This challenge involves brushing data to detect if shops or merchants are submitting multiple orders to boost their sales. 

The metric used is concentration rate = number of orders placed under a shop per hour

The threshold is 3. If the concentration rate is above 3, we deem the shop as committing this act. 

The challenge was hosted on kaggle. The challenge lasted 3 hours.
