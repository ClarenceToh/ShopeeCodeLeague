Shopee Code League 2020 

Special thanks to my team, StayGeekyGuys.

## Description
Shopee Code League is a 2-month online coding challenge consisting of a series of competitions, online algorithm questions and online training workshops open to all students and professionals across the region.

The competitions are specially designed by the Shopee tech teams.

## Order Brushing
This challenge involves brushing data to detect if shops or merchants are submitting multiple orders to boost their sales. 

The metric used is concentration rate = number of orders placed under a shop per hour

The threshold is 3. If the concentration rate is above 3, we deem the shop as committing this act. 

The challenge was hosted on kaggle. The challenge lasted 3 hours. 

## Search Engine
This is one of five code problems in the competition hosted on HackerEarth.

The main challenge was to count number of occurrences a query from a user appears in actual item names. 

This is to aid in a functioning search engine.

## Logistics
This is an analysis to obtain orders which were delivered late. The results may be used to analyse ways to improve delivery methods to achieve higher customer satisfaction.

The main challenge was to get the differences in the number of business days which includes Monday to Saturday, excluding the public holidays. 

Thereafter, the differences in the number of business days was compared to the Service Level Agreements for the different routes (eg. Manila to Luzon).

Also, there were data for 2 delivery attempts, so if any attempt was late, the order will be labelled late. Otherwise, it would be on time.
